                <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
                <p>At Hintz Family Dentistry, we designed our offices with our patients in mind. By combining a calm
                    atmosphere
                    with modern technology, we have created a place where our patients receive the quality of dental
                    care
                    they
                    need and deserve. The moment you walk in our front door, our team will make you feel comfortable,
                    secure,
                    and cared for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team of dental professionals has undergone a series of continuing education courses to keep us
                    up-to-date on the latest dental techniques and industry standards. At Hintz Family Dentistry, we
                    give
                    each
                    patient personal, one-on-one attention to explain procedures, listen to concerns, and answer
                    questions.
                    Most of our staff is fluent in Spanish and English so we can help each individual patient with their
                    own
                    needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hintz Family Dentistry strives to provide lifetime care because oral health is integral to overall
                    health.
                    Our philosophy is to provide care that will be in your best interest now and in the years to come so
                    you
                    have a smile that will last a lifetime.

                We strive to give you a beautiful smile as economically as possible. Our knowledgeable staff will
                research
                your insurance benefits and explain what your coverage entails. We make sure that you know how much your
                treatment will cost before it has begun. We ensure that you know why you are in need of the treatments
                we
                recommend.
